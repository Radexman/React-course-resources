# **What is React**

A JavaScript library / framework created and maintained by Facebook
that is used for building user interfaces.

React gives us a way to build websites & UIs with organized and
reusable components.

## **UI Components**

Every part of a website is looked at as a single component eg. navbar, button, modal.

-   OUTPUT/HTML (JSX)
-   LOGIC (JS)
-   STYLE (CSS)

## **What you should know before**

-   JavaScript Basics - Data structures, loops, functions, etc.
-   The DOM - Document Object Model.
-   High Order Array Methods - forEach, map, filter, reduce.
-   Arrow Functions.
-   Async Programming & Fetch API / Axios.
-   NPM (Node Package Manager).

## **Why learn React?**

-   Organization
-   Reusable Components

## **Declarative code**

```jsx
<App>
	<Header title="Employee Manager" />
	<EmployeeSearch />
	<EmployeeList employees={employees} />
	<Footer />
</App>
```

React is very declarative. We can picture the result of this code by the declarative elements.
